Issues/todos:

RV32 supervisor support:

  - SCALL, SBREAK, and SRET.
  - Interrupt support.
  - Trap illegal instruction and CSR accesses (unpriviledged too).


Peripherals:

   - Reading serial register DATA AVAIL triggers a read side effect.  The
     proper way to deal with this is to generate the read byte enable
     as well and propagate that.

   - Raise interrupts on RX full and TX empty.

System:

  - Timer (CSR COUNT and COMPARE + interrupt).
  - Support external memory and add caches.
  - Traps: instruction {misalignment, address, illegal, priviledged},
    fp disabled, {load,store} {misalignment, fault}.

  - Virtual Memory (eg. TBL + sw filler support).

Under debate:

   - Use CSRs for IO to lessen the memory bus burden.
