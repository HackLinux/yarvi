Issues/todos:

   - Reading serial register DATA AVAIL triggers a read side effect.  The
     proper way to deal with this is to generate the read byte enable
     as well and propagate that.

   - IO shouldn't burden the memory bus; transition to use CSRs for IO.

   - The simple implementation should use unified memory for
     instruction and data

   - Finish RV32I: Add CSR, RDCYCLE[H], RDTIME[H], RDINSTRET[H], SRET,
     and exception/trap/interrupt handling
