Issues/todos:

   - load of serial DATA AVAIL triggers a read side effect.  The
     proper way to deal with this is to generate the read byte enable
     as well and propagate that.

   - Finish RV32I: Add RDCYCLE, RDTIME, RDINSTRET

   - IO should burden the memory bus; transition to the use of CSRs

   - the simple implementation should use a unified memory for
     instruction and data

   - RV32G and CSR suport.  Limited exception handling, interrupts
     support.
